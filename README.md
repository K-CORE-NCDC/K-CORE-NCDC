### 🚀 Projects

- [synthetic-data-set](https://github.com/K-CORE-NCDC/synthetic-data-set)
  The visualization pipeline was evaluated using synthetic datasets designed to mimic real-world genomic data distribution. These datasets were generated by anonymizing and randomly modifying the values from the publicly available LinkedOmics dataset, thereby simulating realistic omics data while preserving privacy. K-CORE artificial datasets were used only to validate the functionality of K-CORE and for demonstration purposes to enhance user understanding.
- [ncc-frontend](https://github.com/K-CORE-NCDC/ncc-frontend)
  The K-CORE portal provides a comprehensive range of visualization tools to support diverse clinico-omics studies. With a focus on the integrated analysis of omics and clinical data, K-CORE suggests various statistical functions essential for precision medicine. The implemented tools are user friendly, versatile, and widely applicable, ensuring accessibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of precision oncology research requirements. All genomic analyses were based on the hg38 reference genome, ensuring consistency and accuracy of variant interpretation.
- [ncc-backend](https://github.com/K-CORE-NCDC/ncc-backend)
  The K-CORE portal is a web-based application developed using Python v3.8 and Node.js v16.0.0. The backend was built using Python, leveraging the Django framework and Django REST API, both of which are widely used for scalable open-source applications. The front end was developed using React.js for the user interface, along with visualization libraries such as D3.js, CanvasXpress.js, Circos.js, and Oncoprint.js. K-CORE uses two databases: PostgreSQL v13.3 and SQLite3. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for storing user information and application-related data, whereas SQLite3 is used for temporary storage when users create custom multidata visualizations. To optimize server storage and ensure the security of user data, we implemented an automated mechanism that deletes SQLite data and associated files two weeks after project creation. However, users can extend the storage period by an additional two weeks if needed.
