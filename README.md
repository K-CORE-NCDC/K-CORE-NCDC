  The K-CORE portal is a web-based application developed using Python v3.8 and Node.js v16.0.0. The backend was built using Python, leveraging the Django framework and Django REST API, both of which are widely used for scalable open-source applications. The front end was developed using React.js for the user interface, along with visualization libraries such as D3.js, CanvasXpress.js, Circos.js, and Oncoprint.js. K-CORE uses two databases: PostgreSQL v13.3 and SQLite3. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for storing user information and application-related data, whereas SQLite3 is used for temporary storage when users create custom multidata visualizations. To optimize server storage and ensure the security of user data, we implemented an automated mechanism that deletes SQLite data and associated files two weeks after project creation. However, users can extend the storage period by an additional two weeks if needed.
